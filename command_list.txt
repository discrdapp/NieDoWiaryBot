List of commands available for the Unbelievaboat-like discord bot in python.
Link : https://github.com/NoNameSpecified/UnbelievaBoat-Python-Bot, to use the bot follow instructions in readme.md
Here I use the prefix "+" but you can change it to whatever you want.

1. Mini-Games
  Blackjack: +blackjack <bet>
  Roulette: +roulette <bet> <space>

2. Balance & Money
  Economy Stats: +stats
  Check Balance: +balance
  Deposit money: +deposit <amount or all>
  Withdraw money. +withdraw <amount or all>
  Give money: +give <@member> <amount or all>
  Server Leaderboard: +leaderboard [page] [-cash | -bank | -total]

2.1 Staff Commands for economy:
  +add-money <@member> <amount>
  +remove-money <@member> <amount> [cash/bank]
    info: default is bank
  +remove-money-role <@role> <amount>
  +clean-leaderboard
    info: removes users that left the server completely.

3. Income Commands
  +slut
  +crime
  +work
  +rob

4. Implemented Customization
  +module <module>
    Get module (income commands) info. Use this info to edit the values.
  +change <module> <variable> <new value>
    Change module settings (income commands settings such as delay, minimum win amount etc).
  +change-currency <new emoji name>
    Change the custom currency emoji. It has to be an emoji you uploaded to the server, not a discord-wide one.
  +set-income-reset <false/true>
    Change "income reset". By default, it is set to "true".
    This means that (if you use collect and not update-income, see below!) the daily salary will NOT accumulate.
    i.e. if you call it, you get X€, if you wait 3 days, you get X€ again.
    If you set-income-reset to "false", the user would get days passed * X€.


5. Items
  +create-item (botmaster required)
  +delete-item <item name> (botmaster required)
    info: remove the item completely, for everyone.
  +remove-user-item <member> <item short name> <amount> (botmaster required)
    info: this will remove one or more items from a user's inventory.
  +spawn-item <player pinged> <item short name> [amount] (botmaster required)
    info: this will spawn an (already created) item in a user inventory.
  +buy-item <item name> <amount>
  +give-item <@member> <item name> <amount>
  +inventory [page]
    info: see your own inventory
  +user-inventory <@member> [page]

6. Income Roles. Whoever has the role will get income

  +remove-income-role <role pinged> (botmaster required)
  +list-roles
  +collect
    User will get their salary. Can/should be disabled depending on what you plan to do
  +update-income (botmaster required. This is to pay all users who have the role.
                  It can be used once a week for example, or whenever you want. The role incomes are daily income.
                  BEWARE: you should use EITHER the get-salary option or the global update-income and disable get-salary)
